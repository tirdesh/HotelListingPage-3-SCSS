Use SCSS to the HotelListing HTML Page.
1. The goal of this assignment is to learn about CSS positioning, Grid layout / Flexbox, and SCSS features like variables, mixins, inheritance, loops, functions, math operations, etc.
2. SCSS should be organized into multiple files based on UI features, common elements, and themes.
3. These SCSS files should be added to a main.scss file and this should be converted to a .css file using sass.
4. The SCSS should be used to create modular and concise CSS code.
5. The navbar should be fixed on the viewport.
6. JavaScript is not required. This will not add more points to this assignment.
7. Your site should look very close to the attached file on Assignment 3.
8. You should not use the table element for formatting.
9. You should add code documentation using SCSS comments.
10. If any asset required for the page is missing then use the below links for placeholder assets.
11. Can use icons from material design https://material.io/tools/icons/?style=baseline even if it doesn't match the UI mock.


# Work Done
1. Used multiple scss files to group content appropriately.
2. Images and icons used are present in the assets folder.
3. Used mixins and variables for dry procedure.
4. Documented comments in scss file, only external style sheet was used.

# To run the code
1. Clone the repository to your local setup.
2. Use vscode with live server to open index.html or open directly via browser.
3. As this assignment is made mostly by using html no additional packages are required.
