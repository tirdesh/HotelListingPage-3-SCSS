# Assignment Description
Use SCSS to the Assignment 3 HTML Page.
1. The goal of this assignment is to learn about CSS positioning, Grid layout / Flexbox, and SCSS features like variables, mixins, inheritance, loops, functions, math operations, etc.
2. SCSS should be organized into multiple files based on UI features, common elements, and themes.
3. These SCSS files should be added to a main.scss file and this should be converted to a .css file using sass.
4. The SCSS should be used to create modular and concise CSS code.
5. The navbar should be fixed on the viewport.
6. JavaScript is not required. This will not add more points to this assignment.
7. Your site should look very close to the attached file on Assignment 3.
8. You should not use the table element for formatting.
9. You should add code documentation using SCSS comments.
10. If any asset required for the page is missing then use the below links for placeholder assets.
